<h4>Introduction</h4>
This program has a client and server script in which one computer has to be a dedicated server in which will save changes and accounts, etc.

<h4>StartUp</h4>
When starting the program, a login/registration window will appear in which you can sign in or register. This will be cross checked with the server database, which is a persistant log on that specific computer. If you decide to change the location of the server to another computer, you must copy the database file and note down the IP of the new computer.
